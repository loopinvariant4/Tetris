1. Smoothen the key press by introducing an initial keydown delay and if it is continuously pressed then have a lower delay. This ensures users with slow taps dont jump two squares but it is fast for continuous presses.
This was a simple trick achieved by decrementing the frameDelay to 0 instead of incrementing it. Insight: This also serves as a future instruction where one could decrement counters to 0 and avoid a modulus operation.

2. Use of a painted rectangle instead of 2d textures to speed up the initial process

3. Separate out the classes that interact with the framework and OS from the pure game logic. This allows for easier testing.

4. Document all your code. For games, we introduce a number of additional variables, states and functions to help with smoothening the gameplay
optimising the code. When you return to your game after a while and you have no idea why something was introduced, it can be demoralising to continue working on this
codebase. So ensure you document everything. It will pay off.
